If we are having speed issues, I can create a lookup
table to substitute the RV string names with a number
so that we are mostly doing number comparisons instead
of string comparisons


for RV in RV_Union:
  assignment[RV] = 0

phi1_var = 0
phi2_var = 0
for i in range(num_settings): #number of different combos of settings of RVs
  product[i] = phi1[phi1_var] * phi2[phi2_var] 
  for RV in RV_Union:
    


probably need to change to log probabilities!!!!!!!!!!!!!
