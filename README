2.1
Double check model and formatting


2.2
Dan Deutsch needs to justify his network

Here is what is left to do
2.3.1
Keith confirmed he did the way we did so we may or may not want to do this again
2.3.2 
I added a section of the algorithmic marginalization 

2.4.1.1
I proof read the proof. Someone else should look over it
2.4.1.2
I proof read the proof. Someone else should look over it.
2.4.2.1
NOT DONE
2.4.2.2
NOT DONE

2.5.1.1
I proof read it and made some minor aesthetic fixes. Someone else should look over it.
2.5.1.2
probably should be proof read

2.6.1
I think these are right
2.6.2
a Needs to be proof read
b I am less sure about this as it is not in the book


2.7.1
a) 100% complete
b) correct answer, but no proof? Do we even need a proof? Perhaps write more about the intuition.
Verified with the program 
c) correct answer, and no proof. Same as above and also verified with the program

2.7.2
NEEDS TO BE COMPLETED. SAME AS 2.3
